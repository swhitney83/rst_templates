Another Edit
********
To Do List:

* New ATM Procedures

  ASAP!

* Vendor Management Procedures

* Foreign Currency Procedures

=======
Lists
=======

Lists should always start with an introductory sentance.

#. Step one.

   Does the text always need to go here?

#. Step two. Or should it go here.

#. Step three.

    I don't think my edits will work...

Table
=======

I liked the table that I found in that RST Documentation link better.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 25 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Heading row 1, column 1
     - Heading row 1, column 2
     - Heading row 1, column 3
   * - Row 2, column 1
     - Row 2, column 2
     - Row 2, column 3
   * - Row 3, column 1
     - Row 3, column 2
     - Row 3, column 3
